    <div class="mainPara">
      <p>&emsp;Hi my name is Nicholas Mercado. I was born in New York and I lived in Florida for a decade. I moved to Seattle five years ago. I bought a house last year and now live in Federal Way WA.</p>
      <p>&emsp;I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a degree in Hospitality Management, I also earned an A.A. degree from Daytona State University in Photography.</p>
      <p>&emsp;I have had many jobs in my life. From Photographer to Cheesemaker but the last three years I have been an Electrician.</p>
      <p>&emsp;One of my many goals is to complete CodeFellows bootcamp and land a great job where I can travel with my wife!
